## User Interface Guide

Although mobile transacting technology has existed for several years, transacting at point of
sale using only your mobile device is still a relatively new concept for many consumers and
cashiers alike. Furthermore, as more applications enter the market, consumers are being
asked to transact in many different ways. Similarly, cashiers are being asked to understand
many different payment processes, and as well as many different types of transactions (from
pay to deposit to loyalty accumulation).
